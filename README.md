# AlphaMC-Libraries
 
Server shutdown and I really didn't work for that much money there are many features in this that were custom effective and efficient

## NMS Things I made
* [Tablist](https://github.com/TewPingz/AlphaMC-Libraries/blob/main/libraries-bukkit/src/main/java/rip/alpha/libraries/tablist/)
* [Scoreboard](https://github.com/TewPingz/AlphaMC-Libraries/tree/main/libraries-bukkit/src/main/java/rip/alpha/libraries/board)
* [Fake Players](https://github.com/TewPingz/AlphaMC-Libraries/blob/main/libraries-bukkit/src/main/java/rip/alpha/libraries/fake/impl/player/) PS. Koupah did look goal so credits to him :)
* [Nametags](https://github.com/TewPingz/AlphaMC-Libraries/blob/main/libraries-bukkit/src/main/java/rip/alpha/libraries/nametag/)
* [Hologram](https://github.com/TewPingz/AlphaMC-Libraries/tree/main/libraries-bukkit/src/main/java/rip/alpha/libraries/hologram)

I also made the [Command API](https://github.com/TewPingz/AlphaMC-Libraries/tree/main/libraries-bukkit/src/main/java/rip/alpha/libraries/command) which was also cool, had async context resolvers and cool tablist complete system where it only lets you tab complete what you have perms to (The feature that is basically on 1.13+) but on 1.7 and 1.8 :D

This code was produced towards the end of 2021, it might be bad now but for then the code was pretty good :)

There are many other things in these libraries, feel free to use it, credit where you like, just building up my portfolio and showing off my skills with NMS thats all :)
